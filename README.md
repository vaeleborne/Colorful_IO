# Colorful_IO

A custom library that uses ANSI escape codes and custom functions to allow for colorful input and output. Mostly intended for std::cout howevery functions can take any std::oustream for the colorful output, just make sure if it isn't an output that supports ANSI escape sequences that you handle that! Also contains a collection of what I consider to be very helpful functions for most terminal based programs. These include but are not limited to, writing a heading, asking a yes or no question, waiting for a key press with a custom message, etc.
